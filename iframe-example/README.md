## Description:
Iframe-example is a simple application that shows how to import webvis viewer into HTML/JS and integrate it into html iframe.

## Technical details
- We are using the [hubdemo](https://hubdemo.threedy.io/repo/webvis/webvis.js) for this example but you can change it with your instant3dhub installation, to do that we need to change it on  [webvis.html](./webvis.html)  on line 8    
  `<script src="YOUR_HUB_INSTANCE/repo/webvis/webvis.js"></script>` 

- Start the [index.html](./index.html) to:
  -  Load webvis into iframe
  -  Initialize the webvis viewer 
  -  Add a model to the scene
