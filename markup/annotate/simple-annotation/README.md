# Simple Text Annotations

![Simple Annotations Example](./thumb.png)

## Overview

This example demonstrates the fundamental usage of the WebVis Annotation API for placing simple text annotations in 3D space. Learn how to create, position, and style basic text-based annotations that maintain their spatial relationship with 3D models.

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Basic Text Annotations**: Simple text content placement in 3D space
- **3D Positioning**: Accurate positioning of annotations at specific world coordinates
- **Basic Styling**: CSS styling for annotation appearance and visibility
- **Viewer Integration**: Seamless integration with WebVis viewer lifecycle
- **Interactive Placement**: Dynamic annotation creation based on user interaction
- **Responsive Design**: Annotations that adapt to viewport changes

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Development Server**: VS Code Live Server extension (recommended)
- **Browser**: Modern web browser with WebGL support
- **Network**: Internet connection for WebVis library and 3D models
- **instant3Dhub**: Access to a running instance

### Running the Example

1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Live Server extension in VS Code
   # Or use any local web server
   ```

2. **Launch the Example**:
   - Open this folder in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   - Navigate to the opened URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5500`)

3. **Interact with Annotations**:
   - **Click** on the 3D model to place new annotations
   - **Rotate** the view to see annotations maintain 3D positioning
   - **Zoom** in/out to observe annotation scaling behavior
