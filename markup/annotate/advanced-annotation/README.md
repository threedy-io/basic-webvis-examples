# Advanced HTML Annotations

![Advanced Annotations Example](./thumb.png)

## Purpose

This example demonstrates advanced usage of the WebVis Annotation API, showing how to create rich HTML content within annotations including images, formatted text, links, and interactive elements.

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Rich HTML Content**: Complex HTML structures within annotations
- **Image Integration**: Embedding images in annotations
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable links and buttons within annotations
- **Custom Styling**: Advanced CSS styling and layout
- **Dynamic Content**: Programmatically updating annotation content
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions within HTML annotations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Development Server**: VS Code Live Server extension (recommended)
- **Browser**: Modern web browser with WebGL support
- **Network**: Internet connection for WebVis library and 3D models
- **instant3Dhub**: Access to a running instance

### Running the Example

1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Live Server extension in VS Code
   # Or use any local web server
   ```

2. **Launch the Example**:
   - Open this folder in VS Code
   - Right-click on `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   - Navigate to the opened URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:5500`)

3. **Interact with Annotations**:
   - **Click** on the 3D model to place new annotations
   - **Rotate** the view to see annotations maintain 3D positioning
   - **Zoom** in/out to observe annotation scaling behavior
