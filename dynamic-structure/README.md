## Description:
dynamic-structure is a simple application that shows how to import Dynamics structures to webvis

## Technical details
- We are using the [hubdemo](https://hubdemo.threedy.io/repo/webvis/webvis.js) for this example but you can change it with your instant3dhub installation, to do that we need to change it on  [index.html](./index.html)  on line 8    
  `<script src="YOUR_HUB_INSTANCE/repo/webvis/webvis.js"></script>` 

- Start the [index.html](./index.html) to:
  -  Load webvis UI
  -  Click "Load Dynamic Structure" button to load the data
